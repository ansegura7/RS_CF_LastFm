# Recommender Systems for Last.FM
Recommendation system with collaborative filtering created with Apache Mahout. The system uses a Music Recommendation Dataset for Research as input, but you can train and predict with any other dataset.

## Data
The original dataset contains <user, timestamp, artist, song> tuples collected from Last.fm API, using the user.getRecentTracks() method. This dataset represents the whole listening habits (till May, 5th 2009) for nearly 1,000 users.

This pre-processed dataset contains <user, song, rating> tuples from the number of times a song was heard on Last.fm.

Table format: **u.data.csv**

| user id | item id | rating |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 100001 | 5.0 |
| 3 | 101943 | 4.6 |
| 6 | 100906 | 4.3 |
| 11 | 101722 | 3.6 |
| 15 | 107070 | 3.9 |

## Output
Once trained the model, the system can make recommendations (on demand) for users, as follows:

| user id | item id | rating |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 1 | 130710 | 4.366509 |
| 1 | 114674 | 3.0061495 |
| 1 | 143895 | 2.9370918 |
| 1 | 103116 | 2.8950827 |
| 1 | 104052 | 2.7250140 |
| 1 | 135747 | 2.6153402 |
| 1 | 135743 | 2.5869453 |
| 1 | 102936 | 2.5726979 |
| 1 | 113273 | 2.5512722 |
| 1 | 114145 | 2.5447776 |

## Technologies and Techniques
- Java (JDK 1.7)
- Eclipse IDE
- Apache Mahout

## Program Execution Rules
The project has an executable in the 'jar' folder. The JAR name is: RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar and you must send as input parameters:
- User ID for which recommendations are to be computed
- Filepath to the input data
- Filepath to the output file
- Type of collaborative filtering: [USER | ITEM]
- Similarity metric: [COSINE | PEARSON | JACCARD]
- Number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm (only applies with user-based filtering). Default value: 51
- Desired number of recommendations. Default value: 10

Execution examples:
```
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 1 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt USER COSINE 101 20
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 10 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt ITEM PEARSON 0 10
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 10 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt ITEM JACCARD
```
The .JAR program must be run with Java 7 or higher.
