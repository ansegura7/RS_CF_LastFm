# Recommender Systems for Last.fm
Recommender systems with collaborative filtering created with Apache Mahout framework. The system uses a Music Recommendation Dataset for Research as input, but you can train it and predict recommendations with any other dataset. This project explores the calibration and accuracy of user-based and item-based models.

## Data
The original dataset contains <user, timestamp, artist, song> tuples collected from Last.fm API, using the user.getRecentTracks() method. This dataset represents the whole listening habits (till May, 5th 2009) for nearly 1,000 users.

The pre-processed dataset below contains <user, artist, rating> tuples. The rating field was calculated by normalizing the number of times a user listened to a specific artist's songs in Last.fm.

Table format: **u.data.csv**

| user id | artist id | rating |
| --      | --        | --     |
| 1       | 100001    | 5.0    |
| 3       | 101943    | 4.6    |
| 6       | 100906    | 4.3    |
| 11      | 101722    | 3.6    |
| 15      | 107070    | 3.9    |

![User-Based 2 - Model tuning](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansegura7/RS_CF_LastFm/master/images/ub-cf-knn.png)

- The training results of the item-based collaborative filtering model are shown below:

## Technologies and Techniques
- Java (JDK 1.7)
- Eclipse IDE
- Apache Mahout
- Maven dependencies

## Program Execution Rules
The project has an executable in the 'jar' folder. The JAR name is: RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar and you must send as input parameters:
- User ID for which recommendations are to be computed
- Filepath to the input data
- Filepath to the output file
- Type of collaborative filtering: USER or ITEM
- Similarity metric: COSINE, PEARSON or JACCARD
- Number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm (only applies with user-based filtering). Default value: 51
- Desired number of recommendations. Default value: 10

Execution examples:
``` console
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 1 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt USER COSINE 101 20
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 10 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt ITEM PEARSON 0 10
    java -jar RS_CF_LastFm-v1.jar 10 ../data/in/u.data.csv ../data/out/output.txt ITEM JACCARD
```
The .JAR program must be run with Java 7 or higher.

## Program Output
Once trained the model, the system can make recommendations (on demand) for users, as follows:

| user id | artist id | rating    |
| --      | --        | --        |
| 1       | 130710    | 4.366509  |
| 1       | 114674    | 3.0061495 |
| 1       | 143895    | 2.9370918 |
| 1       | 103116    | 2.8950827 |
| 1       | 104052    | 2.7250140 |
| 1       | 135747    | 2.6153402 |
| 1       | 135743    | 2.5869453 |
| 1       | 102936    | 2.5726979 |
| 1       | 113273    | 2.5512722 |
| 1       | 114145    | 2.5447776 |

## Conclusions
1. Apache Mahout is an excellent fast development framework for Recommender Systems projects. It has a wide variety of Machine Learning algorithms to make predictions (recommendations) and an extensive list of similarity functions.
2. In static or semi-static scenarios, recommendation systems with items-based collaborative filtering offer better results than those users-based , since it is easier to calculate the similarity between items than between users.
3. As a general rule, both in the user-based and in the item-based models, the predictive results improved when the models were exposed to more data (75/25 or 80/20), since the Machine Learning algorithm used has more information from which to learn.
4. The construction of a model items-based takes more time than the construction of a user-based model. However, once the model is built, it makes predictions more quickly and above all, more accurately than the user-based one.
5. When a new user is created, the user-based recommender model will have a **cold start** for that user, until the user performs enough interactions to be able to look like someone else. Analogously, it occurs for the item-based model when a new item is created.
